/* Leetcode
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/paint-house/description/
 * There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the 
 * three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a 
 * certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no 
 * two adjacent houses have the same color. The cost of painting each house 
 * with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix. For example,
 * costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; costs[1][2] 
 * is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on... 
 * Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

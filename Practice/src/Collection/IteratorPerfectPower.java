 * One way is to maintain a min-heap of several power values of prime numbers.
At beginning, the heap only contains [2, 4]. It is ordered by power values (not base)
Next, return 4.
Inside the iterator, increase 4 to 8 by multiplying 2, i.e. remove heap top [2, 4] and add [2, 8].
Also find prime numbers between old heap top 4 and new heap top 8, which is 3.
Add [3, 9] to the heap.
Next, return 8.
Remove [2, 8] and add [2, 16].
Find prime numbers between 8 and 9, which is null.
Next, return 9.
Remove [3, 9] and add [3, 27].
Find prime numbers between 9 and 16, which are 5, 7, 11, and 13.
Add [5, 25], [7, 49], [11, 121], [13, 169] to the heap.

As we discussed in previous post, finding prime numbers under a given number n takes O(n) time. So, as next-value goes up, the running time of next method becomes O(n) where n is the returned value.
In the meantime, the size of the min-heap grows up too. As next-value goes up, the space complexity becomes O(m) where m is the number of primes under n.

Another way is to find the next-value on the fly, i.e find a perfect power between n and n*k where n is last return next-value and k is the corresponding base-value.

Given a number n, there are a couple of ways to test whether it is a perfect power.
Suppose n = a^b (b>1)
Method 1: We have logn = b*loga, i.e. b = logn/loga. So, for each 2 <= a < n/2, check whether logn/loga is an integer.
Assumes that Math.log runs in time O(logn). So this algorithm runs in time O(logn^2).
Method 2: We also have b < logn+1. So, we can use binary search to find a in [2, n/2) such that a^b == n.
There are logn b's and binary search over n/2 numbers takes time O(logn). So, this algorithm also runs in time O(logn^2).
So, the overall running time of next method is O(nlognlogn).

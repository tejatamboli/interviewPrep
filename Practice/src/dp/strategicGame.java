/* 
 * Problem: Problem statement: Consider a row of n coins of values v1 . . . vn, where n is even. We play a game 
 * against an opponent by alternating turns. In each turn, a player selects either the first or last coin from the row, 
 * removes it from the row permanently, and receives the value of the coin. Determine the maximum possible amount of 
 * money we can definitely win if we move first.
Note: The opponent is as clever as the user.
There are two choices:
1. The user chooses the ith coin with value Vi: The opponent either chooses (i+1)th coin or jth coin. 
The opponent intends to choose the coin which leaves the user with minimum value.
i.e. The user can collect the value Vi + min(F(i+2, j), F(i+1, j-1) )
The user chooses the jth coin with value Vj: The opponent either chooses ith coin or (j-1)th coin. 
The opponent intends to choose the coin which leaves the user with minimum value.
i.e. The user can collect the value Vj + min(F(i+1, j-1), F(i, j-2) )
F(i, j)  represents the maximum value the user can collect from 
         i'th coin to j'th coin.

    F(i, j)  = Max(Vi + min(F(i+2, j), F(i+1, j-1) ), 
                   Vj + min(F(i+1, j-1), F(i, j-2) )) 
Base Cases
    F(i, j)  = Vi           If j == i
    F(i, j)  = max(Vi, Vj)  If j == i+1

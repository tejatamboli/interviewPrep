Given a list of employee id and manager id pairs, and given a manager id print/return the manager hierarchy, starting at that manager. For example, given (manager_id, employee_id) as [(1,3), (2,3), (3,4)] and manager_id 4, return {4:[3], 3:[1,2]}. How would you handle the opposite direction, i.e. given an employee_id print the hierarchy of managers.  
Create hashmap like this and then keep iterating.
4->3
3->2,1

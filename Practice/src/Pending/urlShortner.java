25. You have a potentially very-large set of documents, which are potentially very-large, and contain text.
 For searching these documents, they've been pre-processed into a (very-large) table mapping words to the 
 set of documents that contain each word. E.g.

(word) : (documents (referenced by ID) containing that word)
Apple: 1, 4, 5, 6, 32
Banana: 5, 6, 7, 9, 32
Cantaloupe: 1, 2, 6
...
This is about designing a system with reverse index like Lucene.
1) Tokenize all documents and extract words out of them. remove stop words like the, a if etc.
2)Create a reverse index. We can create index of reverse index as well. Reverse index is structure where against each token( word) we store documents ids.
3) now when user send query we can extract documents against each indivdual words from reverse index and then do a "AND".
4) Right thing to do is to use distributed architecture and store documents on multiple machines. We can store our index in memory and do sharding of indexes and also stire index on multiple machines ( HDFS architecture)
use map and reduce

Clients will pass in a set of words (e.g. {apple, cantaloupe}), and want the set of document IDs that 
contain all the words. (e.g. {apple, cantaloupe} -> {1, 6}) Design a distributed system to implement this, 
bearing in mind that the number of documents, the number of words, and the number of document-IDs-per-word 
are potentially really, really big. 

26. How to apply the function of finding a string in the text of vim editor?  problems in linear time, 
such as KMP and Boyer-Moore, etc.

36. How to find if nodes in graph are exactly 1/2/3 edges apart. how would you distribute graph across 
machines.

38. Implement a delayed scheduler for jobs using pthread apis (mutex/cond_var)
39. You have bunch of numbers coming in, and a given a window size, how would you save numbers soâ€¦ that you 
can return number if present in window and provide average for current window.
40. They want me to design a scalable prototype of basic information retrieval system.
41. For me all the coding questions are coming from geeksforgeeks, one is about string matching, the other is 
set partition. The system design question is about basic information retrieval system, like a search engine 
prototype. If you are not familiar with this topic, the first chapter of Introduction of information retrieval will cover everything you need to know for the interview.
42. Design a system to integrate education certificate from external vendors to LinkedIn. 
43. Rest systemdesign. Amazon website design. Read/Write locking. Generate all factoring components. 

d) Design an Hangman. { They expect MVC architecture. }  

45. - How will you design an app (client) & server to implement a word guess game. For e.g. app will ask 
user to guess the word (it will show blank spaces first equal to size of the word) one character one 
time. He will have 'n' chances to guess correct word. Based on the result, he will win or loose money (prize).
46.  number of ways you can solve this problem.
  - WAP to implement function public String replace (String originalString, String pattern, String 
  replacement) Cover all boundary cases. Write clean code
  
50. You need to distribute a terabyte of data from a single server to 10,000 nodes, and then keep that data
 up to date. It takes several hours to copy the data just to one server. How would you do this so that it
  didn't take 20,000 hours to update all the servers? Also, how would you make sure that the file wasn't 
  corrupted during the copy?
51.  Implement a hash table  and Describe prototypal inheritance.  
53. my own web crawler system.

58.design amazon.com

61.like load-balanced message queues, distributed hashmaps of sorted structs containing 5 URLs and their 
timestamps, and using LRU methods to GC the old data. I had to ask for a hint, but that likely sealed my 
fate. The better, but certainly not the only, solution would be to use buckets of a fixed time interval. 
Seems easy, but often times the bad ideas just won't go away when under pressure.
  How would you design an enhancement to the LinkedIn homepage that displays 24-hour trailing lists 
  (5-minute, 1-hour, 1-day) of the top 5 URLs that users post onto the site?  

62.  Given an interface called IntStream with methods 'bool hasNext()' and 'int next()', implement the 
function 'IntStream merge(IntStream[] streams)' where each input IntStream produces strictly increasing, 
possibly infinite number of, integers, and the resultant IntStream also produces strictly increasing 
integers by merging the input streams. The interviewer also provides a simple test harness that prints the
first 5000 integers from that function.
